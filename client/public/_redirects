# Netlify SPA redirects - the correct way to avoid infinite loops
# This will only redirect when the requested file doesn't exist
# Assets, CSS, JS files will be served normally
# Only missing routes get redirected to index.html

# Specific route redirects first (optional, for explicit routes)
/flash /index.html 200

# Catch-all for SPA routing - this won't cause loops because:
# 1. Existing files (CSS, JS, images) are served directly by Netlify
# 2. Only non-existent paths trigger this rule
# 3. Status 200 is a rewrite, not a redirect
